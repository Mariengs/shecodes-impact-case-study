## Introduction

In the rapidly advancing field of technology, the presence of gender disparity remains a significant challenge. **SheCodes**, founded in October 2017 by full-stack engineer Matt Delac, is a pioneering platform committed to bridging this gap.

Originally conceived as a small in-person workshop aimed at teaching basic coding to 10 women, the initiative quickly expanded due to high demand and positive feedback. SheCodes is now a fully online global platform dedicated to fostering inclusivity and diversity in tech.

This case study explores the inception, growth, and impact of SheCodes, highlighting its role in reducing the gender gap and shaping thousands of women‚Äôs careers worldwide.
