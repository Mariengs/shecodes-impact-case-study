## Introduction

In the rapidly advancing field of technology, the presence of gender disparity remains a significant challenge. **SheCodes**, founded in October 2017 by full-stack engineer Matt Delac, is a pioneering platform committed to bridging this gap.

Originally conceived as a small in-person workshop aimed at teaching basic coding to 10 women, the initiative quickly expanded due to high demand and positive feedback. SheCodes is now a fully online global platform dedicated to fostering inclusivity and diversity in tech.
